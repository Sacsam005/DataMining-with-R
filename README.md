# DataMining-with-R
I have decided to work on a dataset of results of 380 Premier League matches in a single season of the year 2017/2018. It is time to examine the performance of each team and predict which team has the most successful home and away season overall. For this project, I have pulled data from (https://www.premierleague.com/results.)
In this project, I will be working on different parts to perform EDA, classification, association, and cluster analysis of my overall data. Hereby; I have attached links which will take you to different documentation of my analysis.
